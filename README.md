# Java Programming Exercises Repository
This repository contains a structured collection of introductory Java programming exercises.
The goal is to provide a clear learning path for beginners and intermediate learners by separating topics into modules that reflect the fundamental pillars of programming: sequential logic, conditionals, loops, arrays, and functions.

Each module includes practical examples and exercises that reinforce core concepts while maintaining clean code, proper organization, and clear problem-solving approaches.

## 1. Sequential Structure
Exercises focused on:
- Basic input and output
- Mathematical operations
- Variable manipulation
- Basic data processing using simple, linear logic

These exercises help build the foundation for program flow and computational thinking.

## 2. Conditional Structure
Exercises that introduce decision-making logic, including:
- if, else if, else
- Nested conditionals
- Basic validation
- Range-based decisions

Examples simulate real-world decision flows such as checking categories, validating data, or computing values based on conditions.

## 3. Repetition Structure
Exercises using:
- for loops
- while loops
- do-while loops

These tasks teach iterative processing, repetitive calculations, controlled loops, and counter-based logic used in day-to-day programming.

## 4. Arrays
Exercises involving:
- Declaration and initialization of arrays
- Iteration and processing
- Searching, filtering, and aggregating values
- Identifying positions of specific elements

These tasks reinforce memory structure understanding and indexed data handling.

## 5. Functions / Methods
Exercises focusing on:
- Method creation and invocation
- Parameter passing
- Return values
- Modular programming practices

This module helps develop code reusability, abstraction, and clean architecture using well-defined functions.

# Purpose of This Repository
The main objective is to provide a structured learning environment for mastering fundamental Java programming concepts.
It is especially useful for:
- Students learning the basics of programming
- Developers transitioning to Java
- Anyone preparing for entry-level programming assessments
- People who prefer a clear, organized topic-based progression

Each folder contains self-contained exercises with simple, readable code that demonstrates the concept without unnecessary complexity.

# Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 17+) — Core programming language used across all exercises
- Standard I/O (Scanner) for reading input
- Locale configuration for formatted numeric output when required

No external libraries are used, ensuring portability and simplicity.

# Code Style and Standards
All exercises follow:
- Clean and readable naming conventions
- Clear separation of input, processing, and output
- Use of standard Java best practices
- Minimal but necessary comments for clarity

# Contributions
This repository is primarily educational, but contributions are welcome.
You may:
- Add new exercises
- Improve existing examples
- Suggest optimizations or alternative solutions

When submitting a pull request, please keep your code clean and consistent with the project’s style.
